# GoogleDriveDownloader
This is a Python script that uses the Google Drive API to download all Google Drive files that are contained in folders. To run this script, first enable the Drive API https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python, this will create a credentials.json file. Then replace the credentials.json file in the folder with the credentials file you created and delete the token.pickle file since a new one will be generated after you run the script for the first time. Finally, replace the oldPath variable with the folder path to your local GoogleDriveDownloader folder and the newPath variable with the folder path where you want the python files downloaded from.
