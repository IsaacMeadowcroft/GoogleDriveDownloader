# GoogleDriveDownloader
This is a Python script that uses the Google Drive API to download Google Drive folders and files directly to computer. You can run this script locally by first enabling the Drive API at https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python, this will create a credentials.json file. Then replace the credentials.json file in the folder with the credentials file you created. Finally, delete the token.pickle file since a new one will be generated after you run the script for the first time.
